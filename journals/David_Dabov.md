Day 1:
After having met our team and with a little brainstorming we have come up with an idea for our website. It will give a survey to users which will filter a list of movies and provide the user with recommendations.

Day 2:
Now that we have our idea down we have begun creating the wireframe for our website on Excalidraw. Kekoa took the lead in creating the document but we all participated in adding features and ideas to the document. We also browsed rapid API to find some third party api’s that could help us populate the data our websites need in order to function.

Day 3:
We continue to work on our wireframe but after having seen the other groups examples with far more details we realized that we needed to beef up our current wireframe. We decided to start from scratch and therefore Mick took the lead this time adding pictures and details to the wireframe that we already had. We now had a much better idea for how our website was going to look.

Day 4:
We finalized our wireframe with all of its details. Today’s primary focus was searching for a third party api that would allow us to use our website and all of its features. While we first looked at an api called movieminidatabase we quickly decided not to use that, because it would have required significantly more api calls than the alternative. We then found another api by the same creator; however, this one contained much more of what we actually needed.

Day 5:
We are working on the issues for our website in order to facilitate user experience and set out our goals for what we want our website to do. Whether or not the user of our website is logged in. Because we do not yet have the project repository we are doing this on excalidraw with Yingling taking the lead. These issues ranged from logging in/signing up to the core features that we want our website to do.

Day 6:
We were working on authentication to create users on the backend to allow us to begin building the structure for our website. We wrote queries for the account and used jwtdown-fastapi. We have also decided to use the mongo database for storing the data for our project.

Day 7:
I was the one sharing my screen today, but as a team we worked together to build the queries and routes to get a list of movies as well as get the details of an individual movie. We were able to accomplish our goals and got the API calls working on FastAPI.

Day 8:
We got our back end finalized today finishing the get details and list as well as working on back end for our favorites list. Yinglin and Tristen were driving today and together we were all able to get the api endpoints working.

Day 9:
We have begun working on our front end design for our website. Mick took the lead and we began by trying to display data from our back end on the website as well as developing the nav bar. We were able to get the list of movies appear on the front end from our website!

Day 10:
We continued working on the front end design for our website and were able to complete the logout and login functions as well as build a form to login users onto our website. I took on the responsibility of coding today. We were able to get the redux state to work on the front end and coded in logic to make a login button appear in the nav when the user is logged out but once they login that link becomes a logout button.

Day 11:
Tristen is taking the lead in coding today. Our primary goal was the implementation of issues into our project as well as formatting for the data on our Home Screen. We coded the movies into a carousel slide deck which we can move through the movies that are placed on cards. This allows for a aesthetically pleasing display of our data.

Day 12:
We worked on getting our search bar completed as well as our search by genres bar. We were able to get both of those done with Yinglin taking the lead. I began to work on formatting the search results however weren’t able to completely finish that section. We also all wrote and completed tests for endpoints on our backend.

Day 13:
Kekoa and I worked on making the movie details into a modal that appears on screen for each individual movie. We also tweaked the back end to get more results for our Get all movies query. At the end of the day we got together to make the merge requests and get the merge conflicts resolved both on git lab and locally.

Day 14:
Today we worked on fixing up some of the issues that we were having with the get all function as well as the favorites. We fixed the issues we were having with favorites and got all of the functionality working on that end. I drove in the morning up until lunch. Then Mick took over in the afternoon.

Day 15:
Today we focused on fixing the bugs of our website! We were having some issues with the search functions specifically with some of the movies not having any genres in their detail page. We added a conditional on the backend so that if the value of the genre key of the database was none we would not get an error. We also worked on formatting and making our site more aesthetically pleasing.

Day 16:
Today we focused primarily on formatting our website to get it to look how we want. We did resolve some lingering bugs on our site as well. Mick was in the drivers seat but we all contributed to formatting. I worked on drawing the logo that our website was going to use.

Day 17:
Today was another formatting day! We worked on adding a background to our website as well as centering the login and signup forms. We all worked together on getting these things working. I was in the driver’s seat today working on the code. Mick and I worked on looking through the flake8 errors and manually fixing them to get them to go away.

Day 18:
Today we finalized the formatting changes on oure website and made sure that everything was working properly. Tristen took the lead on formatting the front end documents for our website. We also worked together on getting rid of our keys.py file and incorporating that third party api key into the environment file. We also ran black on the file to make sure the backend formatting was good to go.
