Week 1 (5/8 - 5/12):

Day 1: 
We thought about what we wanted to do for our project and decided that we'll be doing a movie recommendation application website.

Day 2: 
We started our wireframe for the website and started looking for movie database APIs to grab data from.

Day 3: 
We fleshed out our wireframe more with what features we would want in our project, such as a favorites and watchlist feature, survey recommendation feature, and ratings and reviews feature.

Day 4: 
We started our API design and found the specific API we'll be using, which is RapidAPI's movie database API. We also finished our overall wireframe and moved some feature for stretch goals.

Day 5: 
We finished our API design, created our user stories/issues, and transferred our notes into the project directory.


Week 2 (5/15 - 5/18):

Day 6: 
We started building up the backend by building the accounts router and query for authentication in FastAPI. We finished the day with having login, logout, and signup endpoints.

Day 7: 
We edited the API design to get ready for the rest of the backend implementation, such as movies list and favorites list, and polished some issues with the backend authentication.

Day 8: 
We built our queries and routers list and details for the third-party API so we can can retrieve the data from the RapidAPI's movies database.

Day 9: 
We polished our queries and routers list and details for the third-party API and implemented the REST functionality for the favorites list queries and routers.


Week 3 (5/22 - 5/26):

Day 10: 
We studied React Redux and React frontend authentication to prepare for the frontend work.

Day 11: 
We started implementing React Redux and wrote out the React frontend authentication.

Day 12: 
We added a query and router in the backend for the third-party API for a genres search function and worked on getting React Redux and React frontend authentication to work. We finished the day with having a login and logout functionality.

Day 13: 
We finished the frontend authentication and started on creating the home page functionality along with a navigation bar. Our home page will consist of a search bar and a list of popular movies.

Day 14: 
We finished our home page functionality which consists of two search bars by title and genre respectively and a carousel of popular movies.


Week 4 (5/30 - 6/2):

Day 15: 
We split up into two groups with one group creating a movie details modal box, so we don't need to make a separate movie details page, and another group creating the signup page.

Day 16: 
We started our favorites page, which would all the movies that favorited would go, and created an error page to catch any 404 issues. We also made additional tweaks to the backend so the search result is more accurate.

Day 17: 
We finished the favorites page and created the watchlist page so users can have a list of movies they've watched on their favorites.

Day 18: 
We polished some edge cases that could occur while searching the movies on the website and changed some designs to better fit the overall style we want.


Week 5 (6/5 - 6/9):

Day 19: 
We started styling the website by having a consistent color scheme and added a website logo.

Day 20: 
We polished a few more edge cases that could occur while using the website and finished styling the home page, login page, and signup page.

Day 21: 
We polished our error page to make it more consistent stylistically with every other page, added pagination to our movies list, and worked with flake8 to format the code for the backend.

Day 22: 
We finished our README.md file in the parent directory, updated our api-design and wireframes, added the API keys to the .env file, and polished the frontend code.

Final Day:
We looked through everything one more time before we turned in everything.
