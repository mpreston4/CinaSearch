	Brainstormed ideas for a project. Decided on a movie site. Also, brainstormed features for the site.

May 9th, 2023
	Found an API to use for our site. The MovieDataBase API will populate our database with a list of movies. We also started working on our wireframe

May 10th, 2023
	Worked on our wire frame some more by providing extra features and details.

May 11th, 2023
	Started to work on our API design, as well as making more changes to our wire frame

May 12th, 2023
	Worked more on our API design, and started a rough draft of issues for us to work on

May 15th, 2023
    As a group we managed to set up our Mongo Database and connect it to our API Docker container. We also managed to set up our login, logout, and sign up endpoints. We also finished authorization as well.

May 16th, 2023
	Perfected our API design in preparation of assigning it amongst our group for tomorrow. I worked on small bugs in our authentication endpoints, such as rasing an errorr if an username has already been used.

May 17th, 2023
	We ended up working as a group to set up our endpoints that invlove a thrid-party API call. We got our list all movies and get details of a specific movie up and running. OLur list all movies definitely needs some work though.

May 18th, 2023
	We worked as a group to complete the rest of our endpoints. This includes modifying our list all movies API call, as well as a post, get, put, and delete for a users favortie movies.

May 22nd, 2023
	Took time to ourselves to study further into Redux and various other things like useState and FastAPI

May 23rd, 2023
	Setup Redux to get authentication running on our frontend.

May 24th, 2023
	Modified API design to better match the return for our endpioints. We also encountered glitches in our frontend routes, but managed to fix that and get our login and logout features working.

May 25th, 2023
	Made a tiny change to our backend to narrow down our search results. We also manages to implement a slider of cards on our frontend.

May 26th, 2023
	Worked on our search bar feature for the frontend. It is then able to send data to another page in our porject which will then display the results as cards

May 30th, 2023
	Worked on mapping a details link for each card to their own movie details page. Also worked on getting each movie specific detail to display.

May 31th, 2023
	Decided to change showing a movies details on their own seperate page to creating a modal that will pop up on the movie list page with additional information provided. We also had to make some changes to our backend tomake sure each movie being listed has the necessary information for a detail page.

June 1st, 2023
	Finished up our modal implementaion. We also worked to implement an error componenet on the frontend. In addittion, we decided to split our movies saved by a user into 2 pages, a has watched and plan to watch page

June 2nd, 2023
	Changed the design of our favorite button as well as fixed errors within our search results. Also worked on updating our navbar.

June 5th, 2023
	Changed the design of our button to signify if a movie has been watched. Also made changes so our site is more uniform, such as making all the cards look the same. We also added a logo for our site.

June 6th, 2023
	Added more small styling changes

June 7th, 2023
	I worked on the back end to include parameters that indicates whether or not the user wants to change pages, which will generate a different lists of movies than the first.
	We also coded the front end to include pagination and display these new set of movies.

June 8th, 2023
	Made our code look neater and more uniform, as well as added our third-party API key to the .env file.
	Made additional changes to our Dockerfile for the api folder to copy all of our base level files and other directories. We also drafted a Read me for the project
