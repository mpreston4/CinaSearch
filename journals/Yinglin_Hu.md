5/8: Our group discussed different ideas and implementations about the project. We decided to do a movie site after discussion. We talked about possible features on the site.

5/9: Our group found a good third-party API as the source of our project. It has a lot of details that keys that we want to display on our site. We worked on the wireframe of how the site will look like.

5/10: Our group continued working on the wireframe and discussing features on there as well as possible implementations.

5/11: Our group member found a better source for the third-party. It is the MovieDatabase from Rapid API. Our group worked on the API design. We discussed on the different endpoints.

5/12: Our group continued working on the API design. We summarized our group discussion on the different issues that we are going to make for each function in excalidraw. The different issues include different functionalities for login and non-login users.

5/15: Today our group worked on the authentication in the backend to set up the different information needed from users to signup or login. We used jwttdown-fastapi to do that. We decided to use Mongo rather than Postgres to try new method to store our data.

5/16: Today our group edited the accounts file in queries and the docker_compose yaml file. We wrote codes to try to make the get list of movies and details of a movie working.

5/17: Our group worked on files in queries and routers to get data from the third-party API. We built the routes and data from the third-party API successfully returned us data in Swagger. We started working on the favorite routes.

5/18: Our group worked on the favorite routes today. A login user can get a list of their favorite movies, add a movie to their favorite list, and delete a movie from there.

5/22: Today our group discussed on whether or not we should use Redux and we came to an agreement on that. We went back for the Redux lectures for ideas on how to implement that in our frontend.

5/23: We started our frontend part of the project today. We created files like store and moviesApiSlice to take care of the API calls and get data from the backend. We also created some other files to set up the route to the site and navbar. We finally were able to get a list of movies displaying in the frontend.

5/24: Our group continued working on the frontend today. We worked on the login and logout part of the project. We built the login form. We worked on the nav.jsx which will display a login button when users are not logged in and a logout button when the users are logged in.

5/25: Our group worked on creating and resolving issues today. We wrote codes for movie cards where they will be displaying in a carousel slide, so users are able to click on the previous or next buttons to see more movies.

5/26: Our group worked on the search by title and search by genre function in our website. We also wrote unit tests for our endpoints in the backend. I wrote an unit test for creating favorites.

5/30: Today we tried to split up work for the first time. Mick and Kekoa took care of the movie details while David, Tristen, and I worked on the signup form. At the end of the day, we got together and solved the merge conflicts.

5/31: Today we continued splitting up work. Mick, Tristen, and I worked on the favorite/unfavorite page and logic while David and Kekoa worked on the modal to display movie details.

6/1: Our group made changes to the favorite button and reformatted the favorite list page. Only logged in users can see the favorite function.

6/2: Today our group fixed bugs of the unfavorite button. We found out that there are some movies contain no genre in the third-party API, so we changed our code in the backend to show no genre in the movie details. We updated our API design to match with our newest ideas. We removed the unused statements from the code and started working on styling.

6/5: Today our group mainly focused on styling. We changed the style of the navbar, movie card, and search buttons. We made login, logout, and signup to work in the frontend days ago, but since we changed the navbar, we worked on those again today. I tested different colors of the search buttons and suggested to the group.

6/6: We fixed some errors showing in the console in the morning. We added a background for the website and centered the signup and login forms in the afternoon.

6/7: Today our group added pagination to allow users to get information on more movies in the backend and the frontend. The group continued on some styling and finished the flake8 formatting.

6/8: Today we fixed a login redirect bug, cleaned up more codes, and wrote the README file. We created an integration document to specify where we get our data from, updated the API design and wireframe, edited the Dockerfile. We also added our gitlab links in the README file. We formatted the frontend codes and added our journals into the document folder.
